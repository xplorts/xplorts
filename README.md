# xplorts - Explore time series datasets

`xplorts` ("explore-ts") is a collection of Python tools to make standalone HTML documents
containing interactive charts.  It is particularly aimed at showing time series data (hence
the "ts") with annual, quarterly or monthly periodicity, such as that published
by national statistical institutes by way of national accounts, productivity, or labour
markets series.

Once created, the HTML documents can be used with any web browser.  They do not need an
active internet connection.
